     Moves the from it's current position, to the given position.
     
     - Parameters:
     
         - to: The x and y coordinate that should be the final possition of the view's movement.
     
         - damping: The damping ratio for the spring animation as it approaches its quiescent state.
     
             To smoothly decelerate the animation without oscillation, use a value of 1. Employ a damping ratio closer to zero to increase oscillation.
     
             Default value: **1.0**
     
         - velocity: The initial spring velocity. For smooth start to the animation, match this value to the view’s velocity as it was prior to attachment.
     
             A value of 1 corresponds to the total animation distance traversed in one second. For example, if the total animation distance is 200 points and you want the start of the animation to match a view velocity of 100 pt/s, use a value of 0.5.
     
             Default value: **0**
     
         - duration: Animation duration in seconds.
     
             Default value: **1.0**
     
         - delay: Animation start delay in seconds.
     
             Default value: **0**
     
         - options: Determines the animation curve.
     
             Default value: **.curveLinear**
     
         - completion: Completion handler. A block of code called right after the ending of the animation. Can be used to concatenate animations.
     
             Default value: **nill**
     
     - Returns: The UIView itself. It makes possible the chaining of similar methods. You can created combinations of animations that way. For example:
         ````
         view.move(to:).fadeOut().rotate()
         ````
         It will make the view move to a given CGPoint, fadeOut , and rotate 180 degrees at the same time.
